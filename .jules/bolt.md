**Learning:** Transitioning from a single JSON array to a JSON Lines (JSONL) format for logging turns an O(N) read-modify-write operation into an O(1) append-only operation. This is especially critical for long-running agent missions where the log file grows with every tool call.
**Action:** Use append-only formats (like JSONL or SQLite) for high-frequency event logging to avoid performance degradation as history grows.
